enabled him to master the great outlines of the epicurean universe of
things, and by a succession of striking imagee end comparieons drawn
from the world os things which was going on before the eyes ol him
end his readers ιο impress this outline on their minda The two first
books appear to be finiehed and ιο heve received almost the last
touches os the author with the exception perhaps of a few lines in the
first and certain portione of the second, pointed out in their several
places The greater pert οἱ these books is devoted ιο a very com-
plete aud systematieal account oi the naturcs and propertiee which
belong to the two great constituente of the universe, atome and void
Given ιο him thie universe in working order there ie much that is

χ striking, much even that may be true, much at all events thet Newton

eoccpted, in this description. We os course cere, not forits seientific
velue or tmth, but for ite poeticel gmndeur and efficacy upon our
imaginatione ; end in these respecta we are most amply eatisfied
'l’he least interesting portione of these books are perhaps the cpieodes
gin which the rival eystems ol' Heraclitus Empedocles and Anaxagorae
‘are examined and refuted They ere closely connected with the
general subject and the poet is much in eemeet, hut, ae was indeed
to be expected end as is pointed out in the proper place, he could
only criticiee them from his own point of view and etarting from his
own principles. The third book is likewise highly finished3 and in
no portiones his work doee he more fully display his power os sus-
teined and systematical reaeoniug. Here too, if his premieeee ere
granoed, his arguments are striking and effective, end carried through

ι with the energy os a fanatical conviction. The poetry end pathos

aud earnest satire os the leet 260 verses are of a very high order.
The fourth book ie in e much less complete condition thau those
which precede Yet in the first pert of it, in which the Epicurean
theory of images is expouuded, he wrestlee with ite gigantic difficulties
aud osten overoomes them with singular power energy and controver-
sial addrese And in truth the most obvious objections to this doc-
trine of imeges apply almost as strongly to the Newtouian theory of
the emissiones light which in spite of them so long maintained its

ἵ groimd. The later sections of the book, which explain the operatione

of the other sennes, the wey in which the mind and the will arc ex·
cited, the theories of sood welkiug sleep end the like, are moro
skctchy and unfiniehed, though they osten ehew acute observatiom
The concluding two hundred verses are very peculiar aud display a
satirical vein es powerfid end much more subtle than thet of Juvenal
'Phe fifth bookis also unaqual: some lew lines, pointed out in their
place, ere almost unworthy of the poet aud seem to have been written
down ιο fill up a gap until he found time to change them sor better.
