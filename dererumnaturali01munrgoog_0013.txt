to bs rho fect Το me the true answer appears simple enough
I will meet what Ῑ believe to be his paradox by stating what he
will think perhaps to be a paradox of mine: the results in Iatin
seem eompsmtively triviel, decom they are in trnth immensurably
greater, because they are the product of four centurias, sc that what
is new and wonderful in Greek, looks commonplace in the other
langnage To illustrate his argument the reviewer points out how
much better Bentley succeeded in restoring Greek fragments than
in emending Horace 3 and rightly refuses to accept Monk’s explana·
tion that he knew Greek better than Latin. Bentley, though his
knowledge of the latter was not equid to that possessed by the
heroes of the lech century, or hythe Madvigs Iachmenns and
Bitschls who have discovered anew for us much that was buried
in the grave of Scaliger, was yet the greatest Iatin scholar of the
age. Why then was he more successful in Greek than in Iatin
emendatiori this will answer the question: suppose he had taken
to emending ¹Sophocles instead of Horace, and the corrupt fragments
of Lucilius scattered through Nonius instead of Menanderz his failure
with Sophocles would have been fur more disastrous than with
Horace, his success with Lucilius more brilliant than with Me
nandcr. The simple lact is that the text of Horace wesin such a
condition es to reject mere conjectural emendeti0n3 while that of
Menander was ready to yield to the first touch of a critic of genius
But really what the eviewer says of Iatin criticism generally is to
me quite incomprehensible. Am I under some delusion, or isit not
true that Madvig, with his consummate knowledge of the languege
and his almost unrivalled genius for emendation, hus donc more for
the text of Livy, than the whole Porsonian school for the whole of
the Greek dramal The way in which, building on the brilliant
labourso Grynaeus in the luth century, he emeuds the last live
most corrupt books, is c marvel of the critical art Look bow
Bitschl takes a rude and imperfect inscription of remote times, conr-
pletes and correcte it sud in so doing extends the limite of the
Latin tongue. Compare with this the vacillating uncertainty and
the imperfect success with which Boeckh handles an Aeolio inscrip-
tion. Observe the masterly power with which Iachmann through·
out his Lucretius breathes lile and meaning into the disjointed
members of Lucilius Had he been spared for a few months longer,
he would have given us this author in such a shapo that no erist·
ing restoration of sny fragmentary Greek r. riter would have borne a
moment's comparison with the work of Lachmann.

But to come to Lucretius: ‘it would be difficult' says the re-
viewer ‘to name a Greek poet who presente a fairer field for con·
iectural skill than Catullus, Propertius, and Lucretius himself.
