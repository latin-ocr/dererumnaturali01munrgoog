of that year; so that here he must be speaking of 15143 and in
hierenae at all events this mode of dating seems tu have been in
common use The editor was Petrus Candidus who, great and im·
portant as the corrections are which he has introduced, has yet used
a copy of the first Aldine upon which to malie them, though he has
never mentioned 1110 name of Arancius It seems to have been the
practice of those times to taire at least whatever was printed with·
out ackuowledgment: thus Giuuta regularly made booty cf Aldus,
Aldus of Giunta in turn. What is said in the present case is
grounded on 0 close inspection of the two volumes. Candidus,
where 110 does 1101 designedly leave him, follows Avancius in the
minutest points 01 spelling and punctuation. The latter for instance
says in his preface that he writes ‘veteres imitatus repertumst,
1100101, 1100000001 and the lilre: Candidus in his preface that ‘in tam
culto, tam nitido, tam undecunque castigato poeta’ he will 1101 ud·
mit archaisms like colpam, uolnera, 0111011011, lanarlptapuamat and
the like. And so in his text while rejecting Avancius’ patefactast,
colrwre, 010, he keeps his srapfferenteia, repareris and 0 thousand such
forms which harenc authority in their favour, while those which he
discards have much. Lachmann always so hard upon Avancius
says< ‘huius ineptissimam scribendi rationem Eichstadius studiose
ἢ imitatus est'‚ hut has not a word of blame for Candidus

But whence has the latter got his many and brilliant correctionsl
for few 01 none appear to come from himself. He says in his ad·
dress to Thomas Setherinus that what he did was to collate all the
catasta exemplaria that were in Morence and to expungo what was
condemned by the obeli of Pantanus and Marullus, ‘praestantissimo-
rum 001010 nostra vatum’. He alludes of course 10 J ohn Iovianus
Pantanus and his friend and pupil Michael Marullus, 01101 Politian
among the first scholare and Latin poets of the most flourishiug
period of Florentius learning, the latter half of 1110 fifteenth century:
‘Marullo ed il Pontan’ have the honour 10 be mentioned together by
Ariosto 1111110 Orlando xxxvn 8. But Candidus goes on afterwards
10 speak only of Marullus ‘cuins in 1100 opere censuram potissimum
secuti sumus’3 and in a note at the end he says that in changing the
order 01 verses here and in most other places he has followed the
⁸ arrangement 01 Marullus To Marullus therefore ererything which
is peculiar to the J natine has usually been assigned, whether in the

way 01 pratae, 01 01 blame as by Victorius and by J oseph Scaliger
who inherited among many other of his father's antipathies his dis-
lilre 10 Marullus But Lachmann has gone much 1011110111οη this,
and has 311011 10 him not only by oversight, as will he seen in notes l,
