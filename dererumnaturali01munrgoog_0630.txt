751-776ι solar eclipses may be caused hythe moon intercepting
the rsys, as the astronomers say ; but some opeque and invisible body
may just as well be the cause; or the sun may lose for the timebis
own light in passing through spots inimicul tc it: lunar eclipses may
, similarly be explained, mutatis mutandis, thuein the first case it
will be the earth which keeps from it the sun's rsys—The three
theories here offered to explain the eclipses of the sun and moen are
ff quite parallel to those given just above to ehew how the meon may
⁴ receive ber light. Epic. ll 96 gives us a similar choico, ἔκλειψις

conaidering what Epicurus’ and Lucretius' conceptione were of the
shape of the earth, they must surely bave blindly accepted from astro-
nomers this fact of its conical shadow: the force of Μετιοιτιιο is not at
once apparent, as she has to pass most months without any eclipse;
yet these do depend on her monthly revoluti0n; and is her orhit lay
