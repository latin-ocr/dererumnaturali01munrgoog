thau belf the book, namely sle-508 and ill ιο the eud, are in his
noblest manner. Nothing in Iatiu poetry snrpsssee, if it even equale
these verme, in grandem sublimity aud varied heauty: occasionally
ιοο some fine teuchos of earnest satire are met w‘itlr: in these pes-
sages, as well as in those mentioned above, he nobly maintains the
reputation claimed for his countrymen in that style ofwritiug. The
sinth book is unequal like the flhh: the beginning as har as 95 is
very unsatisfactory and confused, es has been pointed out in the
notes Then follow some hundred verses in which the nature and
working of thunder and lightning, the formation of clouds rain and
the like are described This portion is most carefully elaborated
There is net much roem for the highest virtues of poetry; but still
great qualities are here brought into play, quiclrneoe ef observation
and power· of deseribing what is observed, vivacity of narrative, fine
perception of analogy and much ingenuity of speculation: the lan-
guage is simple terne direct telling. Most of these merita are displuyed
in greater or less measure even in the flettest and most proseic por-
tions of the poem ; bnt the verses here spoken of are not of this
number. Qnite reeently Ι was glad ιο find the opinion Ι had long
entertained of this section of the poem confirmed by the greatest oi

and this is not the only plaoe in which Goethe expresses the most
unbounded admiration for our poet What follows is not so satisfac
tory: Lueretius has te include a great variety of questions in a very
limited space These seem ιο be selected sometimes at hapharard:
nearly 200 lines are given to the magnet, good aud lively verses
enough and very ingenious, but out of all proportion ιο the subject-
matter. The description of the plagne ef Athens concludes the
book: it is manifestly unfinished ; and though it contains much noble
poetry‚ it suffers from the unevoidable compurison with the austere
beanty and simple grandenr of its original, which the poet hes not
always understood and frum which he has sometimes departed without
good cause. He has slrevvn himself here both too much and too little
of a physicisn: he is too technical for the poet, ιοο inaccurate for the
philosopher. ⁸
[An accomplished scholar in the eleth number of the Edinbnrgh
review gives an estimate of Lueretius differing widely from thet of
the preceding peges He finde not only his rhythm, but his style
and language as well, to be immature, prolix, incondite3 his garrulity
to him is like the ntteranoe of a child3 his osea-e mrigeum, campini-
