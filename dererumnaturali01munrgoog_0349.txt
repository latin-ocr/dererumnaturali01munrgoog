have exposed itself to the shafta of satire The effect which Dryden
and Pope produced for some generations on English poetry gives but a
faint uotion of the sovereignty exercised by the Angustan poeta
And yet Lucretius had no slight influence on the poetry of succceding
ages, although the first mention cf his verses according tc the inter·
pretation usually given is anything but complimentary. Iallude of
course to a sentence of Cicero written a few months aster the post's
death and probably at the very time when hia poem was first pub-
lished At the end uf a short letter to his brother Quintus, 11 ll,
written early in 7 00, occurs this sentence as itis given in all msa
Lucretii porrecta at acribia itu suat mahta luminibus ingenii multoe
tomca unis. N early all editors are now agreed in writing s'ta sant,
aon multis cet.; but sense alone must determine the right reading:
to put non before mrdm tomen artes ie quite as easy an emendation
What then is Cicero’s meaningl we have not the criticism of Quintus
which called forth the remark to enlighten us At this period when
the νεώτεροι, as Cicero calls them, were striving to bring the Alexan·
drine style into fashion, there seems to have been dmost a formal
antithesis between the rude genius of Ennius end the modern art
Itis not theu impossible that Quintus may sc heve expressed himself
on this head, that Cicero may mean to answer ‘yes you are quite
right iu saying thet Lucretius has not only much of the native genius
of Ennius, but also much of that art which to judge by most cf the
poete of the day might seem incompatible with it’ Thus the mss.

write either medice tamen etiam artri or mdtoe etiam artis is hardly,
if at all a greater change thau to insert noa lachmann however
has no doubt that noe must come before multis: hc says Cicero could
not deny to Lucretius art: ‘quod in Marco sane mirandum esset,
quippe qui eius artis qua Lucretius pollet ne minimam quidem partem
in carminibus suis adsecutus eset contra idem cur pauca ingenii
tarnim in Lucretii carmine animadverterit, non potest obscumm

every one feels that ingenii lumino means here precisely what ve
