To notus 1 5

cubedded in an enormous commentary which displays amid much
cumbrona learning no slight acquaintance with the Iatin poete,
l several of which he etlited before and after his Lucretius. He thus
¹ deacnbee what he has donc: ‘contulimus non sine aerumnis vigilus
l que diutinis codicem veneti Hermolai: et Pomponi romani: codi-
cemque non omnino malum: qui servatur Mantuae in bibliotheca
qudam suburbana: qui fnit viri non indocti gentis daiissimae Stro-
1 tiorum. non defuit Philippi Beroaldi praeceptoris quondam mei:
nnnc collegae: impressus quidem: sed tamen perpense emmnatus·
Oodri quoque grammatici Bononiensis: cuins copis mihi per Bartho-
losnenm Blanchinum virum eloquii excultissimi lacta est: Marulliqne
poetae industria mira castigatum non defuit exemplar Severo Monsco
= Placentino graece latineque perdocto musarum athleta non gravatim
offerentc'. He makes no mention at all oi the man to whom he vas
ί most indebted, Avancius3 sor his text is a reprint of the first Aldine,
with however not a lew changes of words or phrases, often ior the
s better, osten for the worse, either inserted in the textor proposed in
j the notes, and derived it may bo presumed in many cases from one
.· or otherus the sources just mentioned. But strange to say when he
makes a change in the text, the lemma os his note nearly always
contains not this reading, but that ot' Avancius as if he had meant it
to stand: thus 19 he rightly reads diffiw lumine ; but his lemma
has diffuso nemim with Avancins, which the latter however correcte
at the end of his Catullus: and he adds ‘sunt qni legunt lumiue’.
15 sor copto he wmngly inserts in the text qaodquc3 bnt his lemma
v has mpla, and his note rightly explains the construction and makes
¹ no mention of quodque. 34 his text properly has Reiecit, his lemma
Rcfficit aster Avancius3 35 his text wrongly gives suspirans, the
lemma suspiciens 3 and so throughout the poem. This very singular
circumstance 1 explain in this way: he was living at Rome when his
edition was printed and seems to have sent the text and commentary
separatcly 3 for the booksellcr prints at the end along page oi errore
with this notice prefixed, ‘Hieronymus Platonicus Bononiensis
bibliopola ad lectorem. contuli Pii exemplar cum edito Lucretio:
labecnlasque pauculas notavi cct’ Pins' edition was reprinted hy
Ascensim in 1514 with not a few changes in text, some of them
taken from the notes. ⁴
The next edition must be ever momorable in the history of Ln-
cretins, that published by Philip Giunta ‘anno salutis xnxu. mense
martio’. Whether this means 1513 new style Ι cannot tell; bnt Ι
know that he datos a Gellius and a Romualdi vita as published in
January 1513, ‘Leone pont max. christianam It P. moderante’ and
‘Leonis X anno primo’. Now Leo X only becaim pope in march
