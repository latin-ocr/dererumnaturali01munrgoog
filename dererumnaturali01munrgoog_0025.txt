epigrama are added: in these too I find no traco 01 Lueretius Then
.follow four books 01 hymni naturales. In these, especially such as
are written in heroios, the strain is ‘of a higher mood', and we meet
with frequent imitstions 01 Lucretius, even in the lysios, as Opibus·
presiate polleas tuis which recalls Ipsa sais pollens opibus. But in
these heroice it is to be noticed that tbe rhythm is Virgilian, not in
any respect Lueretian even where hs closely follows the latter’s lan·

uno non tantum insolito, quod ertu (100000 Noa cupit et quantum

time is full from beginning to end of Lucretiae phraseology. In this
edition too he inserts two new verses in the poem ‘de poetis Latinis'
spoken 01 above, Nature moysi vassa lametii Iepore musaeo tut
tis, the bastin the poem and recalling musaeo 0001ἰο00100 cuneta
lepore. Crinitus l.l. 31111117 quotes this poem and mentions a con-
versation he had with Marullus in which ‘factum est iudicium nuper
a nostro Marullo de poetis Latinis egregie perfectum et prudenter',
and Ovid and other poets are blamed3 and then it is added ‘itaque ,

What his authority is for that which he says 01 Pontanus I do not
know, but Naugerius editor 01 the Aldine 01 1515 properly omits
the line, though he in general minutely copies the J nntius Now
this line is written by the hand 01 Angelo Politian in the margin 01
a manuscript which belonged to him and forms xxxv 29 of the Lau·
rentian library. Politian died in september 1494, when Marullus
could hardly yet have done much for Lucretius; and besides this as
he had been long the deadly enemy 01 Politian, it is not likely the
