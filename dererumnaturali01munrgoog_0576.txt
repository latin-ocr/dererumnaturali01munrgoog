777-817 : thie question offere many difficulties: why does a man
think oi whatever hs wishes to thinlr,¹ ses or earth or ekyi while
others in the same place heve quite other thoughts: why too in sleep
are these images seen to move rhythmicallyl are they forsooth trained
by arti oris it that in the least sensible time many times are latent,
in which many images can appear l the mind again, like the eye, iu
order to ece must often attend and exert iteelf, else they will pass
unheeded: again the mind adds many false iniercnoes to what is
seem-818 loll are immediatly connected with the pmaage ending at
776 ; and our present paragraph discussos the same questions as that
passage sometimes in the same, sometimes in a different spirit, without
the leat reference to it Iacb is therefore incontestably right iu
including this among those subsequent additions which Lucr. made
ιο his poem, but did not live to incorporate fully with the rest. The
poet is evidently embarrassed by the prodigiose difficulties which
thie theory oi mental apprehension involves aud etmggles hard to
solwe them: not content with the preceding paragraph, he hes tried
to better his argument in this one. 779 quod depende on cogitare
understood irem cogitet: cogitet id ipsum, quod cogitare libuerit.
‘haec quaestio’ says Lamb. ‘quare quod cuique libuerit, id cogitet,
cum cogitatio simulacris excitetur, pendet ex superiore oet’: these
