Lucr. is fond of this doctrine that the death of one thing isthe birth
of another and that the uniformity of nature is thereby maintained.
We shall have to say moreat 11 70 of this theory as applied to the
universe of things: as here applied to this world of ours it is hardly
perhaps consistent with what is said 656, that the process of destruc·
tion ia much quicker than that of construction. Elsewhere too he
argues at great length and with much munestness that this world is ·
of quite recent formation, and again that it not only can but must
and will be destmyed in a moment of time. What becomes then of
this unvarying equality, at least thus unoonditionally applied, aec
ndum Rem qiqni cetl Lucr. doubtless had in his thoughts the old
dogma of the physici, more than onos asserted ογ Aristode, aa metaph.
