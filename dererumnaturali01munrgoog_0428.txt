eso-874: the-homoeomeria 01 Anaxagoras is equally defective:
everything hs supposes to 0000101 01 infinitsly small partiales 01110
same nature 00110 111031 10000 01 small bones, 001 soon: he denies
too void and any limit 10 the division of things, 11110 those above
mentioned: such firstbeginnings 00 these cannot resist destruction3
00 that things would return to nothing. Again,as 1001 100100000

01 il'ycu say all 1001 has partiales like the parts 01 110 body con-
tained in it, then meat and drinlr consist 01 particles different in
kind: the same dilemma will apply to what grows out 01 11000111,
