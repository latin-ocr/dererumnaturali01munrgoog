voras 11 ’ 337

‘open’ according to all its analogias in Latin Greek and as we are
told Sanscriti Pontanus ap. Victor. says ‘dias i. lucidas'. Lucr. uses
the word only twice aster this, 11 172 dia voluptas and v 1387 pas·
amm...osia dia: in the former place the meaning ‘bright’ would
be snitable; in the latter that of ‘in the open air': comp. Varro de
ling. Lat v 66 ‘hoc idem magis ostendit antiquius Iovis nomen 3
narn, olim Diovis et Dispiter dictus, id est dies pater. a quodsi
dicti qui inde, et dies et divum. unde subdivo dius Fidius’, and so
on: also vn 34 he quotes from Pacuvius (l) Caelitum amula, espec·
tosa adversm salve hospita and efter explaining camillus and camillas
continues ‘hinc casmilus nominatur Samothrece mysteriis dius qui·
dam administer dis magnis': then too surely the name of the myste-
rious dec diu, who had her attendant camilli, whether she were
Tellus, Cerea, Ops, liora, Fauna or Diana, or all or none, had some
connexion with the bright open air3 so also that os Diona. Virgil
uses the word only once, 1165? dia Camilla, who 543 is also an-
millc and consecrated to Diana While correcting these notes, l
find a passage in Max Mueller's science of language aad series,
p. 453 which shows that Senserit scholare find a similar uncertainty:
‘we get the Sanskrit άουα, originally bright, afterwards god. It is
curious that this, the etymological meaning of deva is passed over in
the dict. of Bochtlingk and Roth It is clearly passed over inten-
tionelly and in order tc show that in all the passages where deoc
occurs in the Veda it may be translated by god or divine Thet it
may be so translated would be difficult to disprove; but that there
are many passages where the original meaning oi bright is more
appropriate, can easily be established '. luminis oras, a hvouritc
phrase by which he seeum to denote the line or berder which divides
light from darkness, being from non-being 3 for he almost always uses
orae in its proper sense, that ot an edge or coast or limiting line.
'l'he phrase is found twice in the annale of Ennius, and twice in
Virgil. 24scribendis matus are of course dativae: comp. georg.
13 taemdc pecori and the note on it in terminalia μδ ; sec alac
Madvig emend Liv. to 1x9 where he properly reads uilia haec capito
laedae spovwionifercmus: ‘dativo gerundivi in consilio significando
&niodum libere Livius utitur, ut 124 me qamdo bello ducem msa

25 de rerum natura: this title he doubtless gave to his poem in
imitation of Epicurus’ great work περὶ φύσεως in 37 books, of which
some miserable and illdeciphered fragments are published in the
volum. Herculaneus. The same title was given by Empedoclesto
