He would appear ιο have been a hsrd sellish unprincipled man
to judge from history and the character given him by Catullus in his
loth ond aeth poema which form a cmious comment on tho ‘worth
and sweet friendship’ which Lucr. found in him, deceived, aa menos
his temperament so often aro, by the specious qualities of a worldly
man: Bothe was already dead when Memmius so flagrantly dis-
graced himself in the matter of the consulship, and went into exile,
abandoned by Caesar to whose party he had impudently gone over.
His country found that ‘the general weal’ could easily enough dis-
, pense with his services His contempt for Latin letters which Cicero
mentions would also seem to lit him but little for patron to so
genuine a Latin post Did Lucr. address Memmius as a believer in}
Epicumsl or did he rather seek ιο convert him to that creedl In either
case bis teaching was sadly thrown away: he called on Memmius ιο
look on Epicurusne a god: it appears from s curicus letter, ad fam.
11111, written from Athens by Cicero to Memmius who had just
gone to Mytilene, that the latter had obtained from the Areopagus ’
s piece of ground on which stood some ruins of Epicurus’ house, and
tlrat he wished ιο pull these down in order to build for himself
Though he had now abandoned the design of building, he churlishly
refused tc give up the property to Patro, at that time head of the
school Patro sud his sect looked on these ruins as a hely place ;
and Cicero out of love for him and his predecessor Phaedrus and
above all Atticus, begs Memmius, as the grourm is now of no use ιο
him, ιο let them have it All through the letter he expresses him·
self, and assumes that Memmius feels‚ tha greatest contempt for
epicurean tenete ; but he says he loves Atticus as a brother, ‘non quo
sit [Atticus] existis [epicureis]; est enim omni liberali doctrina
politissimus 3 md valde diligit Patronem, valde Phaedrum amavit'.
And surely Lucr. too had exceedingly astaemed Patro, exceedingly ¹
loved Phaedrus: Id cinerem aut manis credis curare sepultos l ,
Most readers of this opening address, like the one who of'bld
placed in the margin of the ms the six lines from the sud book, must
have been struck by its curicus contrast with the poat’s philosophical
principles Bayle in his article on Lucr. n I says it is most reason-
able to call it a ‘jeu d'esprit'. Lucr. seeing that all poets invoked
the musas at the beginning of a great work, did not wish ιο ιο with-
out a like ornament and chose Venus as the divinity most auitable
tc a natural philosopher: in the same way he invokes Oalliope r’194.
There is some plausibility in this: Calliope we at once feel to be sn
ordinary personilication of the apic muse; and had Lucretius’ addicas
ιο Venus had no more depth of feeling in it than that to Calliope,
or other poets' invocatione of the muses, we should have accepted her
