euco extended far into the Augustsn age, though they wrote in what

was to themselves really a dead langusge. It is owing probably in
great measrueto his admiration for Lucretius that Virgil and thereby

Latin poetry were saved from falling even more than they did under

this baneful influenee. Epicurus os course Lucretius would study for ’

other pur-posce than those os style, in which ho would have found him
but a sorry masten but the Greek writers still wholly or partly
extant, whom, to judge by his imitatione of them, he most loved and
admired, were Homer Euripides Empedocles Thucydides and Hip-
pocratea Donbtless too hc had carelully studied the old philoso-
pher-s Damocritus Anaxagoras and Heraclitus, but mainly for their
philosophy. Plato he would seem to have known something of horn
more than one passage of his poem. His illustrioris contemporary
Cicero had like him an intense esteem for Ennius, a profound con-
tempt for the ‘cantores Euphorionis’ who presumed to despire Ennius.
Many years before Lucretius wrote his poem (licem in boyhood had

fragments are preserved shews much spirit and vivacity of language,

aud reason without which all other gilts were vain, and alter him
to Democritus and the other early Greek philosophare. Empedocles
receives his homage partly aa one of these, but mainly because begare
