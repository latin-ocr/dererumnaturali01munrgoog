amnssed I have endeavoured to put into as concise and com·
presseda form as possible; though much of this material needs ·
perhaps to ιο recorded only onos and might ιο greatly abridged
if it has ever ιο appear again in a new shepe.

The length of the explanatory notes calls I fancy for less

binus publishod the first edition of his Lucretius 3 and from that
day ιο thie nothing new and systematioah nothing that displays
paine and researoh has been done for the elucidation of our au·

what was suited ιο 1564 can hardly satisfy the wants of 1864.
No defence then is needed for the extent of this division of my
commentary: if it were done over again, more would probably
have ιο ιο added than tehen away. It will not ιο so easy per· ⁸

of the explanatory notes3 end if it had been left undone, they
must have been enlnrged in many directione Our author too
unless I am mistahen will admit of being thus treated better
than most; and the fashion of literal translatione seems ιο ιο
gaining ground in this country as well ae in Germany end

likeness of the poet which appears on the titlepage. With Κ. Ο.
Mueller, Emil Bmun and other judges he is convinoed that the
original on a blaok agate represents our Lucretius The style of
urt and the finely formed letters of the name point to the late
republia Almost unknown then in other respecta, in this he
has been more fortunate even than Virgil, whose sooalled por·
truite are all 1 am told late conventional and unreal
