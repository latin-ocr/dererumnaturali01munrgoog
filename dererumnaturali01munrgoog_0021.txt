editor, if editor he can be called ; for it exaetly reproduces for the
most part the Verona edition even in the minutest points of ite per·
verse punctuation. There are however throughout the poem not
a few differences in the two editions 00100 of little, others of greater
importance3 for example lv las-191 (190) are wanting in the
Verona, but not in the Venice The reason why Ι dwell on this
fact will appear presently.

In december 1500 Aldus published his first edition of our poem,
the first systematic endeavour 10 make it intelligible throughout
The editor was Hieronymus Avancius of Verona, who dates his
dedication ‘Kalendis Martii. n.1n', old style I presume, and really
therefore 1500: an interval of twenty-two months between the two
dates would not be easy 10 understand. Avaucius is known by other
works also, especially the Aldine edition cf Catullus A slight
inspection will shew that he took either the'Verona or the Venice
edition, upon which to form his text 3 a more careful examinatior
will prove that it must have been the latter. Our critical notes will
furuish many other instances; let me here only mention that iu
111994 he and Ven. have torpedine for cuppedine, while Ver. reads

turpidine ; 1011 he takes from Vera its remarkable reading 09111110, ’

which Iachmann adopts and wrongly assigna to Marullus: Ver. follows
the Layden and all other known mss. in reading epectas3 1015 he
and Ven. have the absurd reading 1111111010 sorticella, where Ver. has
the equally unmeaning hiala. Ven. therefore is the ‘ante impressus'
spoken of by Aldus Avancius’ preface shews that for his day he
was a good and well-read Latin scholar, and had studied Priscian
N onius and Macrobius for the illustration of his author. Aldus 111
his prefatory letter to Albertus Pius confinns this, and says that he
knew Lucretius by beart, ‘ut digitos unguesque suos’. Avancius in
his preface asserta 11111011 the same ,· and the few critical remarks he
there inserts, shew that this was true 01 least to a certain 0111001
At the same time he admits witha seeming candour that owing 10
1110 immense difficulty of the work he has left much for others to do.
Much indeed he has left undone; and it would have been a hercu-
10011 task for one man fully to correct the desperately corrupt Venice
edition, especially in those days when 111010 were but few extraneous
a 0111001111 the art of systematic criticism was yet in its infaney, two
generations having yet 10 elapsa, before it reached its full growth in
the hands of the illustrious school of French critica What he has
11000 however ia very great and entitles him to high praise, if it is
indeed his own. But this shall be considered presently. The next
edition is that of the well-known scholar Ioannes Baptista Pius,
