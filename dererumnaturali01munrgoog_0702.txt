simple words Lucr. expresses with some poetical embellishment in the ,
ast four vss. ofhis poem: Thuc. completas the above sentence with thie

sisamoi 51 καιομένου ἄλλου ἅνοθεν ἐπιβαλόντες δν φέροιεν α’τῄεσανι “

>he meaning ct* these words is giren with similar ambellishment in
she vsa 1247-1251 which we are now considering. As the end ot'
she poem is in an nntiuishcd state, and es these vsa es well es 1225
tre clearly out of place having no connexion either oi sense or
grammar with the context, is it not probable thet they, like so
nany others. are incomplete aketches and marginal additions of the
›oet's which he intended, but did not live, to embody with the rest
»f the poem, and which his editors, not knowing what else to do, put
nto their present place, almost it may be at banhaznrdt Lachmanu’s
reatment oi these vsa is highly unsatisfactory: cernebant isa violent
hauge; and the lacrimis lasci laesaque redibant he refers to these
sokers cn who hnd something else todo in attending on their sick3
rot to those who bad struggled to bury their dead, though that must
e their meaning3 nay it seems to me almost certain that the poet
neans by these words to express the ἀπῄεσαν oi Tbue. 11 1247
‘rique aliis olium has at present nothing to govem it, perhaps never
rad ; for the poet may never have completed the sentence: Aureliam .
