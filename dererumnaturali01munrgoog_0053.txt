the latter: ‘hypotheses non fingo' should be the rule in this as in
other matters Aa said above, all these uncertain spellings fell
under a very few general heads One of theseis the assimilation or
non-assimilation of propositione: iopcro represents the etymology,
impero the pronunciation of the word. From the most ancient
period os which we have any record, centuries before Oicero or Lu·
cretius, a compromise was made between these oppoeing interestsz
words in common use soon began to change the consonant, those in
less common use retained it longer. In the new corpus inscrip
tionum Latinarum, the most recent of which are as old as the ageos
Lucretius, moetos them much older, imperator occurs 26 times, and
is always spelt with m, proving that in a word, which must daily
have been in everybody's mouth, etymology iu remote times yielded
ae was natural to sound: imper-ium again occurs three, inperium six
times, being doubtless in somewhat less common use Now in Lu·
cretius emotum impero or imperito occurs 'eix times, and the mss
always spell with m, and eo Lucretius spelt I have no doubt: indeed
many of these common words the eilver age 1 believe more frequently
wrote with ra, than did that os Cicero. Then Virgil uses imperium
40 times 3 and Ribbeck's capital mss have m in every inetance,
except M which twice has inp, though one even os these two cases
is doubtful: ior Aen. vm 381 Foggiuius prints impertio. Yet iu
defience of all this evidence Wagner gives us inperium, surely with·
out reason on any view of the case ς for the foundation ou which we
must build is thus withdrawn from under our feet Το take another
common incarceratione occurs 9times in the ccrpue ins'cr. and
always with οη 12 times in Lucretius and always with m. Other
words are more uncertain: we find in the mse. impias and inpias,
ieamortdie aud inmortalia, waliyeve end colligere, compleo and coer·
piso, and so with other propositione ab, ob, sech, ad: all tending to
prove that usage was in most words uncertain. Again we have
exsto and acto, areolos, walo coepiro expecto cet, s being generally
omitted, and this agrees with Quintilian 174 who implies that it
was a learned affectation oi some to write corpedo in order to dis
tinguish aa· and specto from a and pecte, it agrees too with all other
good evidence: the mss. of Virgil furnich precisely the same testi·
mony as those of Lucretius, yet Wagner in all such cases writes
ere: surely we should keep cc where the mss keep it, cccc where they
have ecs: and so with euptcr or acor, suptilia or eahtilaa, ob· or op,
ob or op, cab or sup, succ or eccae, and the like: appareo occurs
ten times iu Lucr. and is always epelt thus by our mss: so apparo,
appatio (both l and iconi), but odpctdai· aud always adporto, od·
porto or alperto, in which words the separate force of the proposition
