POSTSCRIPT TO THE, SEOOND EDITION

In compliauce with opinions ιο which Ῑ could not but defer, this
edih’onhaebeenso far altered in its external arrangement that the
text and notes may be had without the translation. The work
itself has Ι trustin many ways been rendered more correct: with
the printed book for a year under my eye Ι have detected ou all
hands ineccursoies and defects which escaped observation during the
laborious procem of putting my materisls into shapc out of e thou· ⁴
send different manuscript end printed sources The critical notes
here boen made et all events more interesting by what I learnt at
Munich of Marullus and Fontanus. The pcet's language has re·
ceircd throughout a good deel of fresh illustretion from Livy, nearly
the whole cf whom I heve read during the lest year ; from Juvenal,
Fronto and some other authors The recently published Hercu·
lanean fragments cf Philodemus περὶ εὐσεβείας, as well as those of
Epicurus himself περὶ φύσεως, have been examincd efresh ; but these
fragments arc in such a deploreble condition thet the results cb
ained are perhaps ruore curicus than valuabla It will be seen
too thet important aid has been derived both from printed eriti-
cisms and the communicatione cf private friends. And here grati.
tudo compels me to specify an article in the Reader of 31 december
1864, manifestly the work cf e most able aud sccomplished Iatin
ahelar. He will find thetin neerly every instance I have eclrnow·
lodged the justice of his animadversione: my only regret is that
the limite tc which hewse restricted have presented his corrections
from being more numerous theu they ere.

There is one question which seems to me to be so importent
for a right understauding of Lucretian criticism, thet Ι cannot
vhohy pass itcrat, though the limite of a postsoript construis me
to be briei An able critic in p. 240 sud 241 of the eleth number
of the Edinburgh review is of opinion that the point on which my
lebeus hus been least suceeesfully employed ia the emendation of
corrupt penges3 that this may be said of lachmann as well 3 that
‘one whose conceptione oi the remedial powers of emendatory criti·
ciam hare been formed on a study of the brilliant restorations which
it has eflected in the text of the Greek poete will be surprised to
find how many of the conjectures cf this “second Bentley'' fail to
carry absolute conviction'. After some further remarks ιο bc cx·
amined proseutly, designed to shcw how little emendatory criticism
hes done for latin compared with Greek writers, he declares that

’ though sever-al solutions occur to him, none is so satisfactory as tc

be worth mentioning: it isencugh for him to note what he believes
