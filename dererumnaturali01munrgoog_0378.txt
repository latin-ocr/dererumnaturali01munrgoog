refuto the dream of a poet seems scarcely a sufficient final cause of so
important a portion of his wcrh 128 meatus, a favourite word of

‘images or idols’‚ εἴδωλα, which are shed from all things, not the
bloodless phantoms, which Ennius feigns tc issue out of Acheron3
and which terrify us when siclr or aaleep. The constr. of this verse
misunderstood by Creech is shewn by ιν 33, which is the best com-

of the poet being subject to fits of delirium, or disordering sickness

Suetonius’ assertion that Lucr. was ‘amatorio poculo infusorem

also uses morte obita. As he treats of the soul and these images
at such elaborate length in 111 and iv, it might seem that the motivas
he here assigns are too narrow3 but the fact is that like a true
disciple of Epicurus 10 wishes 1ο persuade his reader or himself that

free man from vain fears of the gods and death, and tc produce that
tranquillity of mind, without which happiness is not possible: he
