tion hus greatly raised my estimate 01 both, especially of Marullus.
His iudustry is at least aa conspicuous as his sagacity: 110110110νί-
dently earefnlly callated manuscripts and editions and guthered mate-
rials from all accessible sources Throughaut the poem the many
verses omitted in the Munich manuscript are supplied with unfailing
diligence. He evidently was acquainted· with several 01 1110011101-
ing Florentiae manuscripts 3 among others that of Niecoli Ι believe,
as well as that of his enemy Politian, and Flor. 31 whose readings
Lachmann so strangely assigna ta the natary Antonias Marii. Upon
the whole he must be placed as aa emender of Lucretius immedi-
ately aster Lambinus and Lachmann, if 1101 indeed in the same front
rank, when we consider the circumstances of his age and the imper·
fection of his materials; and Pantanus perhaps uiay rank after
him. Lambinus as well as Avanciua and Naugerius editor of the
second Aldine must harahad accoes to some capy of Pontaaua' cor·

firmed in 0000111111111011110Ἰ There were in circulatian different copies

man who studied Lucretius sa long and earnestly 00111101 fail 10 have

often changed his mind on further reflexion aad with new sources of ἵ
information. Candidus does not by any means follow Pantanus or j

Marullus in his orthography: that is formed aa we proved in our

first edition mainly on Avancius. In many cases they might have ¹

amasis, 0110111010. Ηο rightly however avoids such barbarisms as
the hymbrae and syloa 01 Marullus. From sacam littus 010101 and
the like, which the latter earefnlly introduces, we may infer that he

and Pantanus had some share in bringing such 'corruptions into com·

of the emendations of Pantanus and Manrllus will prove their im-
portunae, and show how rash and unfoanded Lachmann’s procedure
is in assigning everything that is new in the Juntine to Marullus:
