10 INTRODUC'I'ION

Gifanius iu preparing his edition had before him a copy 61 the
Venice 61611495, 1661 16 him by th'e zealous scholar Sambucus, as
he 1661111661 both in his preface 1ο Sambucus and in bis address to
the reader. In the former he says ‘exemplum Lucretii ad 66616-
disti, non illud quidem calamo exaratum, sed ita vetustum 61 116-
66661, 61 116661 optimi manuscripti 166111, siquidem in eo vidi om-
nium paene mendorum origines, quae magnam partem a Michaele
Marullo, cuius immutationes 16 66 6166611166 61661 661666, primum
parta, 16611 admiserunt Florentiui cet': in the addrese he speaks 61
the ‘Samhuci liber quem ipsius Marulli manu adnotatum, magno
pretio vir ille praestantissimus paravit'. . Why 11166 Lachmann p. 6
should write ‘nequeenim facile Gifanio 6161616 possum Marulli
ipsius manu annotatum 161666 illud exemplar impressum quod se ab
Iohanne Sambuco utendum accepisse scribit’ I cannot comprehcnd.
Gifanius was a dishouest plagiary, but 61 the same 11166 6 16661

’ astute man. Why should he tell 6 gratuitous falsehood which Sam-

bucus would 61 6666 1616611 Η6 was writing only two generations

11166 that Avancius got 11616 Marullus much which the J 661166 does
not 166611, and 66 the other hand that Candidus took from Avan-
6166 without ackuowledgrneut much that lachmann and 6111616 as-

did borrow largely, very largely 11616 Marullus especially in the case
61 interpolated verses made by the latter. How is this 16 bc cx·
plaiuedl Evidently even before his death Marullus' labours on
Lucretius were known3 and probably there was more 11166 666 copy
61111666,11166116661 always agrecing with the other. On this point
