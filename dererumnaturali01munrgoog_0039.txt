native sagacity, guidod and sharpened by long and varied experience,
saw at a glauce their relations to each other and to the original 116111
which they were derived, and made cleanthe arbitrary way in which
the common texts had been constructed. His zeal warming as he
advanced, one truth after another revealed itsell' to him, so that at
length be obtained by successive steps a clear inaigbt into the eondi-
tion in which tbe poem left the hands 61 its author in the most essen·
tial points Like many other great scholare he seems to have kept
few or no common-place books. Resolved to master his subject he
perused the grammarians and poeta and nearly the whole 61 the older
writers in order to illustrate Lucretius through them aud them by
Lucretius, and the latin language by all. He bad an almost un·
equalled power ol grasping a subject in its widest extent and filling
up the minutest details. One mark 61 a great original critic, which
eminently belongs to Lachmann, is this: even when wrong, 116 puts
into your hands tha beat weapons for rofuting himself, and by going
astray makes the right patb eaaier for others to find Another test
is this, when his inlinence extends sar beyond his immediate author.
Now hardly any work ol' merit has appeared in Germany since Lach-
mann’s Lucretius in any branch 61 Latin literature without bearing
on every page the impress olbis example When heis better known
in England, the same result will follow here. Though his Latin style
isemineutly clear lively and appropriate, yet from his aim never to
'throw away words, as well aa from a mental peculiarity 61 bis, that
be only carad to be understood by those whom he thought worthy to
understand him, he isoften obscure and oracular 611 a first reading.
Hsd his commentary been twice the length it is, it would have been
casier to master. But when once fully apprehended his words are
not soon lorgotten. Hislovefor meritos all kinds incites in him a

his autbor; while his honest scorn and hatred 61 boastful ignorance
and ignoble sloth compe] him to denounce those whom he conticis of
these offences Iu one instance, that 61 Forbiger, this sternness pasees
into ferocity: most 61 his errore that scholar corild hardly avoid in

Old Hermann warns ua, when we disagrea with Lachmann, to
think twice lest we, not he, be in fault. His defecta however must
not be passed over. While the most esseutial part 61 his work, the
collation 61 the two Layden msa, bas been perfomied with admirable
skill and industry, he bas not been so happy in the use 61 secondary
evidence, that 61 the Italian mss. aud the older editions. Mucb he
has taken on trust on insufficient evidence, and much that he had
before him he has not always aocurately imai. Some pruofs 61 this
