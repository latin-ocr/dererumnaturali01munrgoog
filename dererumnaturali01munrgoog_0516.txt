1 you would think there was au antithesis in these two uses oi primu,
there being none whatever: there is thus no occasion to read priva
with Beutk in these two places, which would then give exordio by
itself the soree of ptimerdia which it nowhere has in Lucr. If a
grain of dnst teuch the body without being felt, then the distance
between two atoma of the seul must be greater than this grain.

381 Nam cet: Lucr. does not venture to say how few they are
compared with those oi the body 3 but theseinstanoes prove he thought
the disproportion ιο be very great: the scot of a gnat or a grain of
dnst teuching the body must touch thousands and thousands of
atoms: if then these can osten fall on the body without being felt,
that is without touching any atoms of the seul, these must be vastly
tewer than those of the body. But does not the body feel aa well as
the sculi yes 3 he has elaborately proved already that the one feels
as well as the other, and that neither of the two can possiblyfeel
without the other; but he has also shewn that the indae motas must
prooeed from the enimn, and not merely from the enimc, but from
that part of it which is the animm, and not merely from the animata,
hut from that fourth nameless substance in it: the eninm and anim
then form one connected whole in the body3 if therefore any atoma
nithe anima are moved they will at once communicate with the
enimus, and sense will commence and be imparted te the whole
anima, audirem the anima to the body which will then feel. But
many atoms of the body he argues may be touched without any part
of the soul being moved, and therefore without there being any com·

895 he seems here briefly te indicate the process spoken of at⁴ 381,
that of the particles of the enimc maeting, mering the cainum, which
excites sense, reacts on the rest of the αηιιηο and then on the body,
thus at last excitiug its sensatior. ³

without the animus the anima cannot remain one instant in the
body, bnt if the former is saie, much of the latter may be cut off

without destroying life: the animaris like the pupil oi the eye, the

least burt to which destroys the sight3 the aena is like the rest of
