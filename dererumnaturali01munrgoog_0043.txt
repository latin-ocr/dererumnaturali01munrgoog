notes Of the other laurentian mss. 29 is to be noticed for the

marginal annotatione 01 Angelo Politian spoken 01 above and often

referred to in notes l: it twice over has this note ‘liber conventus '

Ι have derived some facts about Marullus The six msa 01 the
Vatican Ι collated as long ago as the autumn of 1819, but not with
much care- or skill3 yet it will be seen from notes l that they have
’ been of considerable service to me: their marks are as follows, 3275
and 3276 Vatia 640 Urbin 1136 and 1954 Othobon and 1706
Regin, at the bottom 01 the first page of which are the words
‘N 100101 Heinsii'.

As further helps I have had Gifanius’ ed of 1595 with ms. notes
by Nic. Heinsius which I bought from H. G. Bohn many years ago:
it will be seen that I have derived from it some valuable emenda·
tions notin Heinsius' adversaria nor elsewhere so far as I know. It
has also a complete 0011011011 01 A all through, of B in the first four
books, and of the Gottorpian fragment It contains 100 0 complete
collation of the codex Medii, which Heinsius denotas by a: he says of
it ‘variantes lectiones excerptae sunt ex libello edito Paris. au 1565
quem Fr. Modius cum ms suo contulit, ut ipse testatur fine libr
inquiens: Collatus 011111 ma meo 26 Junii 1579 00101110οἐ 11 was

from Nausius, Nansius from Modius himself Heinsius says ‘codex
Modii non est idem cnm B Vossiano, nam pag. 8 [1227]1111111
· Modiano notatum ad lamina, Vossianus ἐπ’. Heinsius speaks I pre·
sume of the small 21111011. of Lambinus, as the one which Modius
used: it has like others ia lumino: if then Modius’ codex is B, either
he or Heinsius has made a gross mistake. Ι hare noticed several
other instances, where a is made to differ from B; bnt in these cases

. Heinsius may have here been misled by Modius' negligence It would

seem then that a and B are the same: if they are two, then their
agreement is very extraordinary, much closer than between B and
the Gottorpian fragment.

I also possess a copy of Faber’s Lucretius with a poor collation of
A and Band 1110 Gottorp. as well as many other notes and illustra·
