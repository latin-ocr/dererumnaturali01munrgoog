rently independent authorities Macrobius and 000 archetype quoting
them in the same way. Perhaps these single vsa might be added to
the list, 01085 00 losannae, 1000951, 1225, 1237,127000
they might all be dispensed with Look 100 01 1v 129-142, so
strangely disordered 10 the mss: 133-135 may be all marginal
additions by 110 001100 afterwards wrongly placed bytho editor. The

’ all these passages are'subtracted, there will then be 10110 not very

unusual 00010001 single verses transposed by the ordinary negli-
gence 01 copyists. The numbers occasionally given on the left hand
01 the page denote 01 course the order 01110 1100010 msa which
lachmann follows in his edition: where spurious vss. of the mss.
are omitted from 110 text, he still allows them 100οο01 For obvious
reasons I have followed him in this, as he will be the future standard
01 0000001000, and there is great advantage in a 00110000 numbering
of the verses.

Since many special questions 01 orthography are noticed as they

to accept even 110 00011001 change in what they look upon as the
usual 00 conventional rules 01 spelling. The notion of any uniform
conventional spelling is quite a chimera: I never find two English
editors following any oniform system 3 nay the same editor will often
differ in different 0001001 110 same book. But whence comes this
‘conventional' system, so far as it does existi from the meritorious

Italian scholare in the fifteenth century to get rid 01 110 frightfnl

cases embraced only a few general heads, they yet comprised 0 great
multiplicity of particular instances, because involving the termina-
