beros lines ina page: oum hed 26 lines in apage, exceptiugonly
those which coucluded a bools But remember there wasa heading
¹ or title at the beginning of each section; and each· of these head·
ings occupied a line. Iachmann brings many proofs of this being
the number. When this ma was copied, it was clearly much torn
und mutilated. It was stated above that four porticus, omitted
in their place by B, oome together at the eud, aud that these
each formed a leaf of the archetype which had firlleu out of its
place and been put at the end. Each of these alone or with ite
hesdinge consuls of 52 linea Then turn ιο note 1 on 1v299-347
(ate-347 299-322) where this inversion is explained iu the saum
way, by the accident that is of a loose leaf being turned the wrong
way: ece also note 1 ιο 1 1068-1075 aud lost-1101, where the
mutilation is accounted for in the same manner Thus we obtain
six certain lendmarks in different parte of the poem The archc-
type therefore consisted of 300 peges, or admitting aa seems to be
an undoubted fact, theta whole leaf is lost between vr 839 aud 840,
of 3023 of which the first and last were not written upon, as well i
as one for some reason or other between 1 785, which ends one of
thelooee Ιοονωοι the end of B, and 1068 which, aa shewn in note 1,
begins a fresh leaf. Pago 190 which followed the end of iv was
lest blank Imay also note that p. 137 aud 191 contained an
index of the hesdinge of rw and v respectively‚ although the dif-
ferent titlee como in their places in these books too, as well es

in the othere which have no such index prefixed. Having made
for myself a list of these peges after the rules stated in various
places by lachmann, Ι have found it of great use; as the ends
of lines throughout the poem towards the bottom of the several
right-hand peges had been specially exposed to mutilation in the
dnmagcd archetype Versae also omitted in their proper places
were apt in this aa in other msa to be put afterwards at the
bottom of pagea Beeides the injuriet which it had received from
accident or ill usage, our archetype must in many respecta have been
very carelessly written, though A and B prove that it retained
many raluable vestiges of great ,antiquity‚ especially in the spelling
of words, end though there may have been few stages between it
and the age of the author. There is oue point, the nature of the
hiatus after rw 126, as to which it is not easy to accept Lachmaun's
theory. That there is a hiatus there, is indisputablo and the special
questions connected with it are fully discussed iu note 1 to that
passage. Aa the occidental loss of a whole leaf would not suit his
system of peges, he boldly declares that twenty-five verses and one
heading have perished, that is one single pege of our archetype.
