beaigme poderam ingeniusouisee. The &emplum in question may
well have been the poem of Lucretius. Professor Sellar in his Roman
poeta of the republic p. 203 though not inclined to admit the editor·
ship of Oioero, yet argues that J erome must be speaking of Marcus
[A brilliant critic in Macmillen's magarine no. 67 p. 52 calls in
. question this tradition and finds it difficolt to get over the fact that
Lucretius is dismissed by (licere in a denen cold worda If however
the whole circumstances of the cese are examined, this difficulty will
Ι believe wholly or in great measure disappear. These deren words
occur in a hurried note to his brother of less than a doaen lines3
itis the only note addressed ιο Quintus during the whole and more
than the whole interval between the death of Lucretius and the
publication of his poem. The only other letters written by him
during those months are a few formal dispatches to officials on
publio business, with the exception of ona brief hurried note to
Atticus written in november hom his Tusculan, ιο which he had
retired for a few days’ relaxation. In thie note he gives half a
duran words to his own de oratore which he tells Atticus is now fit
for publication and may at once be transcribed by his copyista He
did not therefore write to Atticus or others about Lucretius, because
he was iu Rome, occing Atticus daily aud, if Lucretius’ poem was
then in hia hands, discussing doubtless with him and others its
merite and condition. I find in (licere no such anxiety‚ as thie writer
finds, about the phrases of any friend's esssy.- The expression
‘inhibere remos’ occurred in hie own academice: he had rashly
allowed Atticus to substitute it in the copies already made for his
own ‘sustinere remoe’. When he found out the true meaning
of that nantical expression, he writes in the greatest barry and
trepidation to try and prevent the solecism going forth to the
world, especially ιο the archeritio Varro to whom the work was
dedicated. The mere mention then of Lucretius, slight as it is,
would seem to indicate of itself some relation between him and the
orator. As remarked in n. ιο 11 1092, it is not Cicero's custcm ιο
quote from contemporaries, numerous as hie citatione are from the
older poete and himself Had he written on poetry‚ doubtless Lucre·
tius would have had a prominent place in it 3 but ewen where in his
rhetorical works he criticises so thlly the oratore of the day, he
abstains from quoting their worda In all his writingu the name
of Catullus does not once appear, though his poemg deal ω much

with the topica and names of the day most interesting to Cicero 3
notwithstanding his brilliant compliment ιο the orator which must
have been thoroughly felt, his agreement with him in politice, his
