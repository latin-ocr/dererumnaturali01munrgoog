ve must hveaaon, I should prefato see it before maltos, Why
Cicero should deny him art, may be explained iu more ways than
oue: he had a genuine lore os Ennius and is indignant that the
‘cantores Euphorionis' should presumo to despice him: he and Lucre-
tius agreed on taking him lor their great poetical model At the
saure time his own Aratea must have been written thirty years
or more before this letter, and he may well have been so iar eon·
verted by the almost unanimous tendency ol the poete os the day
towards that style of diction aud werse which was gruduslly leading
up to the werke of Virgil aud Horace, as to deuy Ennius and Lucre-
tius much art In that early worlr for instance Cicero suppressos the

Ἴ final s of short syllables just as heely as Lucretius does: in his orator

written two or three years before bis death he says oi thie licenoe
‘iam subrusticum videtur, olim autem politius'. What remeius ol
their poetry, proves that both Augustus and Maecenas had formed
their style rather in the school os Catullus and Calvus than ol Virgil
aud Horace ; yet doubtlcss they would have rated the art ol the
latter more highly than that ol' the former. Or Quintus may have
dwelt on Lucretius’ philosophical qualities3 sud Cicero who is couti-
nually jaering at Epicurus for his want of art end scientilic discipline,
may ponibly include Lucretius in the same condemnation. How-
erer that may be if Cicero did deny him ingenium, then did the
great Roman orator display less teste thau the orator aud philosopher
ol Arles Favorinus two centuries later when, as Gellius 1 tl recorda,
he spoke of Lucretius as poetae ingenio etsocsmdic praecellentia [But
iu this new edition I cannot help suggesting, whatI have long sus·
pected, that the corruption does not lie in thewords cited above, but
in those which follow. 'I'he short letter thus concludes according
to the mss: Lucretii poemata ut scribis ita sunt multis luminibus
