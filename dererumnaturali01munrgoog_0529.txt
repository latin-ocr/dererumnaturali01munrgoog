lvo-w& again how absurd that immortel souls should be pre
sent at eonoeption and fight who shall get tbe mortal body, unless
indeed they bargain, first oome first served ι wo matio or oonnbjol
there is no other certain example ol the word in Luer. as v 1013
Uenetiam is introduced by conjecture: many and reoently Luc,
Mueller de re metr. p. 258 argue for the two quantities oi the word:
the latter says ‘notabile quidem debuit videri tot exempla durissimae
syniresis eur noluerint vitare poetae ponendo oonioyiom vel mae
yiolem . sed enirn augebitur admiratio reputantibus Lnoani et
Senecae, qui nunquam ι’ vel re. mutarunt in somonam, versus tales
Mox oti οοποιίί pretium mercesque adoleat. Conubia vitat: qenes
Amazoniam seins. porro Statius 'syniresin enm alibi non plns septiens
admiserit, in uno voeabulo mutii, si productam habet semper seeum
dam, deciens octiens eam adhibuisse erit eredendus': he further ahews
that the old grammarians Consentius and Servius hold it to be short
in sueh cases Conington to Aen. 173 observes ‘the analogy οἰ
pronubas innubae might be pleeded as proving a vadation of quan·
tity; bnt no clear instance of cenobium occurs exeept in Sidon.
Apoll': Prudentius also has it short ; and claudian a far higher
metrieal authority than any os the Christiane writes epist. 1118
Vectigal euriae wnobiole lyrae: it is quite true that in the time of
all these writers the native feeling lor quantity was utterly lost and ·
did not then exist in the Roman world3 it was learnt only from trs·
dition by Olaudian and Servius as much as by Prudentius or us; bnt
in reply ιο Conington's pertinent remark it might be said that the
word is not used stall by Tibullus and Propertius nor in bis lysios
and elegiaos by Catullus3 that Ovid has only the form mithio in his
elegiaos3 that the word in the singular or dat and abl plur. oecur-
ring so often as it does in some writers, in Virgil 8, in Statius 18
times, is always found with the u in thesis, never onoe with it in
arsis, and that though Lucan who resolves the ii oi the gen. twice
uses conubii, Virgil Aen 1v 167 ohoosee to say omacius aeter Conse-
biis, not Conehii: it is quite possible that Virgil and after him Ovid
may in these doubtful cases have wished not ιο deoida a moot point,
and ιο leave their readers to fix it lor themselves: see what is said
at 1042011 perlecta like Εοίιις the sensitiveneas oi Virgil and Ovid
on doubtful points os quantity seems ιο have been very grean and
osten they avoid such altogether—But I now have the eonvio-
tion that here it is conubio: I have taken mortalia whioh would be
equivalent to mejero or οοοιῖρἰα, and find that Luor. has mortalis
23, mortalia 14 times3 it is therefore beyond all reasonable probability
