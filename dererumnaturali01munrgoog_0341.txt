any other people. But hardly had Demosthenes and Aristotle ceaaal
to live, when that Attio which had been gradually formed into such
a noble instrument of thought in the hands of Aristophanes Euripides
Plato aud the oratore and had come ιο supersede for general use all
the other dialects bacam at the same time the language of the

« civilised world and was stricken with e mortal decay. It seems to

have been too subtle and debeata for any but its wonderful creatora
Nsy the style and rhythm even of Menander who 'was born in Athens
years before the date just giwm shew a falling off, if he be compared
with Aristophanes The Alexandrina poets who imitated earlier
stylos and even the gracelul Theocritus repeat parrotlike forms
which they do not understand, because their meaning had been lost
sor ceuturies. If what is said of a Menander and Theocritus be
thought presumptuous, there is no question that it is true of prose
writers Epicurus who was born in the same year as the former
writes a harah jargou that does not deservo to be called a style; and
others, of whose writings anythurg is left entire or in fragments, hia
torians and philosophers alike, Polybius Chrysippus Philodemus, are
little ii at all better. When Cicero deigns to translate any of their
sentences, see what grace and lise he instils into their clumsily ex·
pressed thoughtsl how satisiying to the ear and teste are the periods
- of Livy when he is putting into Latin the heavy and uncouth clauses
oi Polybius! This may explain what Cicero means, when at one
time he gives to Greek the preference over Iatin, at another to Laun
over Greek: in reading Sophocles or Plato he would acknowledge
their unrivalled excellence ; iu translating Panaetius or Philodemus
he would feel his own immensurable superiority.

In three pisces Lucretius complains of the poverty os his native
tongue: 1 136 he says in general terms that he is aware how difficult
it is to express in Lada verses the abstruse discoveries os the Greeks.
But could a Greek poet express thern in Greek versesl could a
Homer or even an Euripides expound the theories of Aristotle or
Chrysippus or Epicurus more clearly than Lucretiual Surely not: in
the second book he has translated some anapaesta ol' Euripides that
consummate master of matured Attio, and there is no thought in
them which he cannot express literally. Certainly in difficult ques·
tiens Empedocles is more helpless than Lucretius, though he had an
apic diction to imitate which had existed for centuriea The second
passage is1 830 foll. where he observes that the poverty of his native
speech does not permit him to express in Iatin Anaxagoras’ homoeo-
meria, but the meaning he can expouud easily enough. And easily
aud lucidly enough he does explain it: the less he or any other poet
Iatin or Greek or English has todo with the word itself the better:
