itis not more poetical than entelechia or homoeosis, or th'e τὰ τίῆν
εἶναι iteelf The third passage is111 218 foll. where he says that he
would fain explain at greater length the way in which the differem
substances which compose the soul are mixed and work together, but
the poverty of his native speech compels him to be brief. Whether
he is brief or not, he explains an intricate question as clearly as any
Greek writer iu prose or verse would be likely to do. One might
more justly object to Lucretius that he has too much instead of too
little technical language for a poet Whatever Greek writer Cicero
wishes to explain, he can find adequate Latin terma to express the
Greek, even if they are those of Plato or Aristotle: isit a new sense
given to a woud in common usef he can always meet λόγος οι· εἶδος
with ratio cr species: is it a‘newly coined wordl his pauidas is quite
as good as Plato’s ποιότης. Nay from the force of circumstances
specics quattus qrmntdas have had a much longer life end a far more

chosen to apply the prolific energy of his intellect to the taslr, he
might have invented and wedded to beautiful language as copious a
terminology as was alberwarm devised by the united efforts of 'l'er-
tullian and the other fathers, Aquinas and the other schoolmen ; from
which the most cultivated modern languages derive the chief portion
of that wealth in scientific terme which enables them to claim in that
respect a superiority over laun But the language of Latin poetry
would assuredly not bave been improved thereby. Ulphilas uo doubt
found his Gothic, Alfred his English, when those idioma were in their
prime, quite as poor in their scientifio terminology compared with the
degenerate Latin of their times, as Lucretius found his latin com·
pared with Greek. That however he, like Cicero, sometimes enter·
tained a more favourable opinion of his language and his art would
appear from such expressions as the twice recurring quod obscuro de
re tom lacida pango Carmina, musaeo contingens cundo lepore.

'fhe Lucretiae hexameter occupies an important place in the his·
tory of Latin poetry, coming es it does between that of Ennius who „
invented and that of Virgil who brought this metre to perfectiori.
What Ennius did in this matter is a carious study: he not only was
the first to introduce this new and strange form of verse into the
language on which it was to continue to exercise so great an influence
ever after, hut he laid down for it lawa of prosody differing in many
essential points from those observed by himself iu his tragedies as
well ss by all the other tragic and comio poets of his own and the
following age. These lawe, transmitted from one generation tosuother,
taught as a necessary part of a liberal education and enforeed on

the writers of elegiae and lyrical ae well as of heroic verse, had
