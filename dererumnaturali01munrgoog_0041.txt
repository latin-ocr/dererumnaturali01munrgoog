points he agrees minutely with the ms. of Nicocli, the oldest of the
Italian mss; and doubtlees therefore gives the reading of the arche·
type. It will be scen in notes l how often I make the united testi·
mony of A and Niccoli to outweigh all the rest. The other Leydcn
ma which Ι call B is of nearly equal importance: it is of quarto siae
closely written in double columns, apparently in the tenth century.
It ie probable that it and thc ms. next to be mentioned were copied
frum some copy of the archetype, not like A from the archetype itself

each an entire leaf of the lost archetype: 16 29 39 115 arethe num·
bers cf these leaves It ie manifest then that after A was copied,
these leaves cf the archetype had fallen out of their places and been
put together without order at the end, before B, or the original of B,

has had several correctore, but all of the loth century ; one a very
brilliant critic for his age, to whom are due many of the finest emen-
dations inthe poem, ae will be seen in notes l. This ma was once
in the great monastery of St. Bertin near St. Omer. Turnebus col·
lated it in Paris and his collation as we saw was used with much
effect by Lambinus: it aftemvards came into the possession of Gerard
John Vossius, Isaac’e father. A large fragment of another ms. closely
resembling B in everythlng double columns and all, except that it is
said to be a small folio, not quarto in shepe, is now at Oopenhngen:
it contains book 1 and 11 down to 456, omitting however the same
sections ae B, via 1 734-785 and 11 sse-304, and doubtless for the
earne reasons, because copied frum the same ms from which B was
taken It usually goes by the name of the Gottorpian fragment from
the place where it once was. Ι heve three collatione of it, oue pub-

Heinsius, another in that of Isaac Vossius Formerly it had a very
high reputation: in trnth it much resembles, but is more careleesly
written than B, and is seldom of much use, except once or twice to
confirm A against B. Strangely enough there are in the Vienna
library fragments of a precisely similar ma containing large portione
of the later books, via 11 642 to 111 621 inclusive, omitting however
in the proper place 11767-806 exectly as B doee; then v1743 to
the end3 then follow, precisely as in B, the four omitted portione
given above, proving this to be copied from the me. from which B
was taken. Naturally enough these Vienna fmgments were assumed
to heloim to one and the eume ms. as the·Gottorpian; but Dr. Ed
Goebel, from whom 1 have borrowed this description of them, seems
