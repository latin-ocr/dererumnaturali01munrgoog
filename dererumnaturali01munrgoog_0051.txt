thus close the door ιο all future change ; bnt knowing that certainty
was not here attsinsble, he carehrlly sifted the evidence offered by
his msa and made the best approximation he could to what his
author might have written, always taking the most ancient form for
which his authorities supplied any testim0ny direct or indirect. Thus
the question was not foreclosed ; nor were we left ιο vagus generali-
ties‚ but a firm historical gronndwork was gained upon which future
improvements might be built, if better evidence hereafter offered
itself. Iaohmsnn then in thie, as in so many other departmente of
philology, seems at once to have produced conviction in the minda of
the majority of the most thoughtful scholare, in Germanyl mean3
for in our own country most seem ιο soont the question as unworthy
of serious attention: a great mistak03 for latin orthography isa
most interesting and valuable study to those who care ιο examine it,
and touches ina thousand points the history gramm and pronun-
ciation of the languaga Let me give two examples of the effect at
once produced by Lachmann: Otto Jahn in 1843 publishsd his ela-
borate edition of Persius in which he adopted throughout the spelling
then in common use, though he hed so many excellent msa ιο guida
him ιο a better course: in 1851, the year after Lachmann’s work
came out, he publishsd the text of his Juvenal and followed in it
most minutely the principles of Iaohmann3 and fortunately hebed
a most excellent authority in the codex Pithoeanus 3 so that the
spelling is probably not very far removed from the author‘s own. In
the years just preceding Lachmann Halm publishsd several orations

‘of Cicero with elaborate critical Latin notes3 and yet, though his
spelling was scmewhat better than that of J ahn'a Persius, it is still
essentially ‘conventional' and arbitrery: in the years following

lachmann he publishsd a series of school editions of Cicero’s orations

with brief German notes, and yet iu these the spelling was wholly ⁶

modelled on the system pursued hy lachmann The same system
too he has carried ont in those volumes of the elaborate edition of
(licere edited by him and Baiter, which came out aller lachmann’s
Lucretius Stimulated by the examples of Madvig Ritschl and
Lachmann the rising generation of German scholare has pnrsued the
critical study of Iatin with eminent success ς and nearly all of thern
follow in orthography the guidance of Lachmann This system then
may fairly I think be now regarded as the true ‘conventional'
system for surely the school of lachmann and Ritechl in the nine-
teenth century has a better right to dictate to us in the present day
what shall be accepted as ‘conventional' than the Poggios and Vallae
of the fifteenth. Ribbeck in his Virgil 'shews himself a most da-
voted pupil of Lachmann, aud generally he takes the right directior] ς
