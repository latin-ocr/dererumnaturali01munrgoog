at one time have contemplated an elaborate edition of the poet and
lias to be added to the long list of scholar-s with whom this remained
an nnaooomplished deaign

We have theu an undoubted oopy ol what Fontanus himself
merted to be his own original emendations3 aud as they are seeu-
rately repeated by Victorius in his second copy, if we subtract these

3 we have in what rumeins tho undoubted eorrections of Marullus

Now the latter with only a few variatione, easily to be aooounoed for
ss being earlier thoughts or iu other ways, all reappear among the
alterations of the Muuich rus which are however much more nume
rous When wo consider all this, and remember that wherever Can·
didus in his notes mentions the name of Marullus, the reading which
beamigns tu him is found here ; that he tells us iu his prefaoe his
text is grounded mainly on the revisions ol Pontanus and Marullus,
the latter more especially 3 that, es our present edition will demon·
strata the numerous readings which first appear in the Juutine,
good bad and indifferent, where not taken from what we now lruow
to be those of Portunus, neeri, 'ways agree with the corrections os
this manuscript 3 end finally that Candidus not unfrequently gives a
new reading poculiar to this of all manuscripts known to me, as in
h'n note to v 826 where he mentions parserat> as a variation, we '
may fairly oonolude that Candidus in preparing his text had the use
ol this oorrscted manuscript, aud that the oorreetor was Marullus

· It would be natural too to oonelnde that this is his own copy
; emended by his own haud; aud l'or the most part I do not doubt

that this is so. Howerer they cannot all hare been written at the

· same time, as the inlr differs in different places, and as so many of

the emendations agree with those of Fontanus, it seems not impro
bable that the ms was iu his possession before it came into tbe

¹ hands of Marullus As the Italian handwriln‘ngs of that egeresem-

ble eseh other so much, at least to onr eyes, the writing ol the pnpil
may not have differed much from that ol the master. However that
may be, we must oouolude that the eorrections common to both
belong to Pontanus, as he was tho elder and we saw above that he
olaims thern for bis own, and the scholar would naturally borrow
from the master. The emendations too of Pontanus, valneble as
many of them are, have the appearance of being earlier and more
rudimentary than those of the other: he not mheqnently too sees
that something is wanting and says ‘fragmentum’, where the latter

supplies a whole werse with more or less success The soholar there·
sore eompleted what the master oommeuoed 3 and the emendation os
Lametius liuks their names together not less honorably thau does the
werse we quoted from Ariosto. Upon the whole this fresh informa·
