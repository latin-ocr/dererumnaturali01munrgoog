latter evei-ything that is in the Juntine, in some respecta more, iu
ethus less credit is given to him than he deserres. As I cau throw
some light on this interesting questioni will examine it at some
length here and in various parts of notes 1.

The scholar poet and soldier, Michael Tarchoniota Marullus Cou-
stantinopolitanus, as he calls himself in the editions of his poema
printed during his life, appears from this title and his epitaph iu
San Domonioo of Ancona where lie and so many of his aucestors

friend Petrus Crinitus, to have been born in Constantinople. As
be can hardly have passed middle life when he perished in the river

mere child when on the capture of his native city he was brought to
Italy, probably to Ancona He must have received his training

presently be referred to, adds ‘quae ab eius quoque sectatoribus re-
cepta sunt pro verissimis’. This intense love of Lucretius he seems
only to have conceived in the latter years of his life. Candidus,
whose prefate full of feeling shows that he greatly lored Marullus
and deeply deplored his untimely end, strives to make the most of
what he did: he says ‘Lucretianae adeo veneris peromnem aetatem
studiosus fnit, ut cet’ But this must be an exaggeration: the first
