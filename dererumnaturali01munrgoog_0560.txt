l'be phenomenon described by Lucr. in these last verses is quite true
and simple, whatever be said of bis explanatione of it, on which
indeed he seems not himself ιο lay much streas. Editors are strange-
ly at sea about a very easy matter. From seeing my image turned
updde down in the bowl of a silver spocn I hastily concluded, as
1 find Gassendi has done, that a concavo mirror always gave an
image thus inserted A distinguished mathematical friend has how·
ever proved ιο me both by optioni and ocular demomtration that this
inversion is caused by the vertical, not in the lesst by the latersl
curvatura. A mirror, laterslly concava, such as I have before me at
this very moment, gives beck your image turned asLucr. asserta, ie.
fsoing you just es if you were facing yourself‚ right ansvering ιο
right, leftto lest„ Probably the Romans had metal mirrors of this
shape for the purpose of getting such an image ; the other side being
conver, so es to suggest ιο Lucr. hia comparison ‘lateris nostri’.
³2³ od aequos flecta: he refers no doubt tc the angle cf reflexion
being equnl tc the angle of incidenoe3 a fact well known to the
Greek and Roman gwmeters of his day 3 of which Lucr. therefore
would not be ignorant How fer it can be reconciled with his
genersl theory of images, I hardly know: an acute correspondent
has pointed out to me many of the difficulties which such an attempt
involves. But the mathematicisn just mentioned shews mein what
way he thinks these difficulties may be got over3 and indeed we see
in the 5th snd bth books thet Lucr. was sufficiently indifferent to
discordant or seemingly discordant theories standing side by side.
My correspondent rightly shews I think that in 320 rec‘edds refers ιο
a person moving along a mirror parallel to its plane, not stepping
back fremit It must be remembered that the ancient mirrors
were but a few inches in diameter 3 and would perhaps not suggest
to Luor. some difficulties which our large lcohingglasses might have
done: 322 Onmic are all abjecte generally which can impinge, a
