rent ways suffered so grievously from Clodia or Lesbia the terrible
‘Clytaemnestra quadrantaria ’, the Medea os the Palatina. It has
been shewn in our notes that more thau once in his philosophical
works he must allude to Lucretius Had the poet been alive when
the de finibus or the de natura was written, he might have taken
the place cf Torquatus or Velleius]

However this may be, it rs certain enough that the poem was
given to the world carly ιιι the year 700, and ιιι the unfinished state
in which it was left hythe author: indeed I hardly like tc say how
strong my suspicion, even my convictione arc, that many of the
most manifest blunders in the poem as we now have it appeared
in the very first editiones it whether from design cr inadvertency:
probably both ; for later in this very year he writes to his brother in
Britain, ιιι 6 6, that he despairs os procuring sor him accurate copies
of Latin writers, ire madore et authentus et emanat. Itis not easy
in any other way ιο explain the agreement of Macrobius and Nonius
with the archetype of all existiug manuscripts in many indisputable
corruptions. The story oi his madneas has been examined by Pros.

Sellar l. l. p. 200. Whether there is any trnth in it or not, it
cannot be doubted that it was already current in Suetonius' time 3 yet
few will deny ‘that it would be strange ii so remarkable a poem had
been written in the lucid intervals of insanity'. This poem was
desigued ιο be a complete exposition of the physical system of Epi·
curus, not for the sake of the system itselfi but in order to free the
minda ol men from the two greatest cf all ills, sear of death and fear
ol the gods, by explaining to them the true nature os things. So
far he followed in the steps ol his master who with the same end
in view composed among many other works one entitled περὶ φύσεως
in 37 books, cf which some wretchedly scanty and incompleta trag-
ments hare been published in the Herculanean volumen How much
Lucretius was indebted to this more important work may be gethered
from the letters of Epicurus preserved in the tenth book of Diogenes
laertius, which give a brief epitome oi his system and have been so
largely used in thia commentary. The pcet’s veneration sor his
teacher would constrain him ιο borrow from him his matter ,· his
manner and style are altogether different. Το Lucretius the truth of
his philosophy was all-important: to this the graces of his poetry were
made altogether subordinate. Το us on the other hand the truth or
falsehood of his system is of exceedingly little concern except in so

sar as itis thereby rendered a better or worse vehicla for conveying

tho beauties of his language and the gracesof his postical conceptione .
Is then the epicurean system well or ill adapted tc these pur-
