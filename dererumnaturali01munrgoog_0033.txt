quickuess of his intellect united with his exquisite knowledge of the
language gave him grem power 111 the field of conjecture, and for
nearly three centurias his remained the standard text. Lachmann
says he did much less than Marullus, But so far as there is tmth iu
this, it is merely saying that the one lived before the other: nine
tenths of what Marullus affected, Lambinus could have done currente
calamo; but Ι doubt whether Marullus could have accomplished one
tenth of what Iambinus succeeded in doing. Lachmann accuses him
of strange levity and rashnesa But it murat be remembered that in
a short life he got through sn amazing amount of work in conformity
with the wenta of his age. He only gave two years and a half to his
brilliant edition of the whole of Cicero; and probably did not spend
many more months on his Lucretius than Lachmann spent years.

“ Nor was it possible in that age even for a Lambinus to apprchend

the true relation of the mss. of Lucretius to one another. His
copioua explanatory and illustrative commentary however calls for
unqualified culogy, and has remained down to the present day the
gread original storehousa from which all have borrowed who have
done anything of value for the elucidation of their author. Scaliger
says ‘Lambinus avoit fort peu de livres': if so he made good uae of
them, as hia reading is aa vast as it is accurate, and its results are
given in a style of unsurpassed cleamess and beauty. His notes

Scarcely could this first edition have issued from the presa, when
the well-known scholar and jurisconsult Obertus Gifanius of Buren
began with systematical and unprincipled cunning to pillage it and
convert it to his own purposes. Hie Lucretius was printed by Plautia
of Antwerp in 1566 as stated at the end, though of two copies before
