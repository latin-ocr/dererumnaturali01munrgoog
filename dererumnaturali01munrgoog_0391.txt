abacta ken-0, 311 ,0155 annis, because the annus was made by
th· nmlution os the sun.- Varro de ling. Lat. vl 8 ‘tempus ἢ hrum
..εἰ brumum, dnm sol rodit, vocatur annus, quod ut parvi circuli anuli,
nc magui dicebantur circites ani, unde annu83 but in Lucr. the
coming together of annis and Anulus is quite accidenml: v 644 Quae
volvunt moyam in nmquis orbibm annos, of stellar years. 312
anulus, not ann. habendo has not the same subject as tho sentence:

mx 17 7 σε daturum, quod nec in dando mc datum ullo eiquo de-
prendi ponet. 313 Staieni: Lach. in a masten-ly note shews that
when a long vowel is followed by le, one l is withdrawn when an i
follows, if this i be not merely the mark of a. case, as villa villis:
thus Almana Messalina 3 millo milia 3 villa vilicus3 stilla 'stilicidium3
for stiria shows that the i of scilla is long. According to this rulo
Polio is right, and Servius reoognises both Polio and Pollio, and
Πυλίων is the usual Greek form 3 but Roman usage seems to have

 

douln-ed for Pollio 3 in the new corpus inser. Lat. vol. 1 Pollio is
found 6 timon, Polio once 3 in Mommsen's inser. reg. Neapol. always
Pollio 3 and so the mss, of virgil 3 but Pal. and Mea fail in the four
places where his name occurs3 Pollio too the collated mss. of Ho-
raoe3 the Pithoeanus of Juvenal vl 387 Polio, ιιι 7 Pollio 3 the pue—
]impsest of Fronto twice Polio. Augustus in his ns gestae has one
striking violation of this law z he always νήια millia millibus milli-
em 3 and one or other of these words occurs moro than 20 times ε he
probably so spelta fmm some notion of consistency 3 comp. his simus
fur eumue: milites militaro etc. he spells in the usual way. 314
occulte: Fore. gives from ovid an exactly similar use of the word.
315 strata vi. Sacc. = stratas saxo vias: strata having the epitheta saxea
shews that Lucr. treated it almost as a subst. 3 even more harah is v1
⁴ 1283 aliena roqorum exe-ructa. He uses this constr. more freely than
most of the poets ε see Conington to Aen. 1 422: we had in 86 a very
bold instance : clama domorum, extructa donwmm, and with a gen. sing.
vera viai, caer-ada caeli, sublima caeli are some of many other exam-
