12 INTRODUCTION

throw fresh light on the history and criticism of Lucretius’ text by
the undoubted corrections 01 Fontanus and Marullus, still existing
among the books and manuscripts of Peter Victorius which have
formed for centurias so valuable a portion of the Munich library.
They were examiued by me and copied out in the summer of 1865,
my attention having been directed to them by a Goettingeu progr-am
01 Ρο01. Sauppe which was lent to me in the previous december,
almost immediately it would appear aster its publication. The learned
writer informs us that he had examinari the Munich ma 01 Lucre·
tius and found it corrected throughout by some Italian scholar.
Where Candidus the editor 01 the J untine mentions in his note a
reading 01 Marullus, this reading invariably appeared among these
correctione From this and other indicatione he concluded, and the
conclusion seemed most reasonable, that these were the very correc-
tions of Marullus which Candidus had used for his edition He
makes the probable suggestion that the long connexion of Victorius
with the Giuntaa would readily explain his 0000000100 01 0 manuscript
which had belonged 10 1101 firm.

At Munich through the courtesy 01 110 librarian Ι had the full
use 01 110 following important documents: the manuscript just men-
tioned: 2. a copy 01 110 Veniceedition of 1495 with corrections by
Pontanus in the handwriting 01 Victorius who describes them in the
first page 00 ‘emendationes ex Pontani codice testantis ipsum inge-
nio aas exprompsisse’: 3. another copy 01 110 same edition likewise
corrected throughout by the hand 01 Victorius who says at the end .
‘contuli cum duobus codicibus, altero Ioviani Pontani, altero vero

Marulli poetae Bizautii, impressis quidem, sed ab ipsis uon incuriose,
ut patet, emendatis, quos commodum accepi ab Andrea Oambauo
patritioFlorentino 00000. Idibus Martiis. Petrus Victorius'. What
the printed edition was from which hc copied these emendations 01

Marullus I (10 001 know: very likely it was this Venice edition
itself which must have had a larga circulation and was the very edi·
tion containing Marullus' 00100 which Gifanius made use 01, 00100
been already told. Victorius says 01 preosda iu 01192 ‘placido in
Pout. libro': now since not only the Venice edition, but the Ve-
rona and first Aldine have 0000010, and also the Bresoian as I leam
from Inrd Spenccr’s librarian, Pantanus must have used some
printed edition now unknown. The pains which so eminente eche
laras Victorius has taken iu copying out twice the emendations 01
Pontunus and once those 01 Marullus would prove 110 high estima-
11οο 10 which those two learned men must have been held when he
was a young man 01 twenty. As he 100 0100 filled a copy 01 110
J untine with long parallel passages from 110 Greek, he must himself
