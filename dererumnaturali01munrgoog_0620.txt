Ι ments you can make with fire here on earth end the fact that so
long as it is visible it does not diminiah in aire, but sooner indeed
lases its brightness, 'you can by reason and induction apply these
facts to the sun and the stara. Again that our world was formed
nearly in the manner just described by Lucr. ia true, because earth
' water air fire of which it is composed always do and must in like
' circumstances act in the way they are there represented as acting.
⁴ But to say that the stare and the sun must more from some one con·
’ trolling cause, or that eclipses can admit of only one explanationes·
’ that lightning and clouds can be formed in only one way is a vain
’ unphilosophical assumption, since they are beyond our powers of ob-
* servation and there are many ways of explaining them equally pro-
bable, to which οὐδὲν τῶν φαινομένων ἐπιμαρτυρεῖ, or οθθὲν πῶν ἐναργη-
’ μάτων διαφωνεῖ and the like: you must not then fear τοὶς ἅνδραποδιθ
das πῶν ἅστρολθγων τεχνιτείοςι to give ona explanation καθῆκόν ἔστι
’ τοῖς τερατεύεσθαί τι πρὸς roais πολλοὺς βουλομένοις, nay it is μάταιον,
and even μανικόν. Well then all the possible reasons which Lucr.
has just given of the motion of the stare are equally unrefuted by
sense, are equally true therefore ,· and though only one of them may
apply ιο our world, yet in the countless worlds, like and unlike oure,
existing in the universe they all may and must liud their place, 1.l.

sas-563: the earth remeius at rest in tho midst of the world,
ιοοιιιιιο its weight gradually diminishes and below itis another na-
ture closely connected with the air above the earth: thus the whole
forms as it were an organic whole, and one part does not weigh
down another any more than one member of the body another mem·
ber, the whole having been united and working together since ita
first formation: see too how the light soal sustains and puts in mo
tion the whole heavy body. , 534 Terraque: anr. dces not tell us
what the shape of the earth ia; but he must have conceived it aa

n. ιο 476 civo: yet it dces appear harah to apply this epithet ιο the
brada terra, the model of Quid οἰι citati crota οοκοιιηιιε recoctam:
perhaps he was thinking of it es forming a sort of organic body with
the air, like the human body with which he proceeds to comparsit.
