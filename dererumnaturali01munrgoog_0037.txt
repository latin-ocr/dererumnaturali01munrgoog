20 INTRODUCTION

edition and hia own X are one and the seme Bodleian ms3 so that we
have this ludicrous result, that the same mss. are cited side by side
as independeut authorities His various readings are therefore not
only cumbrously inane, but are a sucre and delusion, sud hare led
astray those who like Wakefield huwe trusted to them. Thus in his
hands the two umivslled Leyden mss. have been worse than useless.
What he does himself is always worse done then what he bortum
from others, poor as thet generally is: he has collated none of the old
editions except the Verona, and that was done for him, sud better
done than he would have done it for himself. Nor are his explana·
tory notes much better: he hes hesped together in a crude mass
those of the chief editors ,· but except in the ease of Virgil and
Horace and one or two others of the best known poets, iudexes to
which sre in everybody’s hands, he has not ewen supplied the refer·
ences to Iambinus‘ learned notes who from the circumstances of his
nge could not himself furnish them ς nay in one case he has given
Iambinus’ own words ss those of Cicero. In his two bulky volumes
there is not oue week’s genuine work beyond what scissors and peste
could do: seldom has performanee fullen so fur short of profession
and opportunity.

There is nothing to dete-in us between steresmp and Wske-
field who in 1796 und 1797 gave bis three volumes to the world,
riwalling the other's in magnitude. Yet the work, such as it is, is his
own, aud is not a mere slothful compilsticn from others Gilbert
Wakefield possessed one quulity which a critic can ill dispenso with,
thet of despising any amount of authority which did not rest on some
real foundation, sud refusing to sdmit that, became a reading had
appeared iu edition efter edition for centruies it might by that alone
claim recognition He therefore set about s new revision which wss
to be based on manuscript authority ulon03 but neither his know·
ledge nor his industry nor his ability nor his taste sufficed for such s
work. He professed to collate five English mss, among them our
Cambridge one, and most of the old editions This tesk he executed
with incredible carelessness. As he hed the full use of the Cambridge
ms, one might heve expected that his collstiou of it would be done
with some care, but itis quite untrustworthy. From this as well
ss the evidence of his own notes end the nature of the case I infer
thet his other collatione ere not more to be depended upon. Had
this labour been faithfully performed, it would still have been of
little use, cs he had no notion of the true relation of these late mss
to oue another. He looked on esch ss su independeut authority end
thought he could not do wrong, if the words he put in his text were
found inone or other of them. Thon he hed to take from Havet-
