Now it iseaay enough, as we have seen, ιο explain the accidental
loss of a leaf, by which every subsequent copy must necessarily want
the contente of that leaf : it is easy enough ιο conceive any one
ma, A or B or Poggio’s, passing over by mistake one whole pmc-
But it is in the highest degree unlikely that different copies, A B
and Poggio's, neither of which as Lachmann admits was copied from
the other, should all pass over a single page of their original; or
that this single page should be wholly illegible, while that which
preceded and the reverse page of the same leaf should be entirely
nniujured lt seems to me therefore much more natural to assume
that our archetype or one of its predecessore accidentally omitted
an uncertain number cf verses; or rather that a whole leaf of the
archetype had beenlost as after vu 839. Lachmann’s system of
pagination would then be set right in this way: only books iv aad
v have an indae οοῳίιιιοη prefixed filling one pege: before this in·
dex in v Lachmann has shewn that the archetype had one blank
page Αεεῑιιηο now that one page was similarly lest blank before
the index cf 1v and all will be right: the peges of the archetype
would then be raised ιο 304.

But wc are able to advance even beyond the archetype: in many
parts of the poem there are manifest undoubted interpolatione, which
must have been inserted by some reader who wished at one time to
confirm whatis said, at another ιο convict it of inconsistency and
the like. Generally, not always, these passages are repetitions of
genuine passages 3 sometimes they consist of several, sometimes of a
single verse: 144-49 and111806-818are good and incontroverti·
blo examples. But enough is said of these throughout our notes.
Lachmann however still unsatiefied hae not paused even here, but bas
gone up to the very times of the poet Nc cereful render will refuse
to admit that he has proved not a few passages, soma of them among
the finest in the poem, to have been subsequent additions made by
the author, which hadid not live tc embody properly with the rest
of his work. Iachmann has gone too far; and unless I err,I bave
shewn that not a few sections, thus marked by him, are properly
connected with what precedes and follows. Yet it is certain that his
theory applies ιο 11 les-183, and more tban one long paragraph of

1v v and va It has been chaun-sufficientIy in the notes ιο these
passages that the most important of them bave a close connexion in
matter and manner with each other. Like Lachmann, Ι have
marked them off by []. All through the poem many single
verses and passages of some length are designedly repeated by the
poet, some of them again and agaim Itis probable that he would
have removed many of them, if he had lived tc revise his work:
