notatu and Awanoius Pius Candidus Gifanius can hardly all have
had the same oopy: perhaps all were different Avancius then may
harahad his notes 'm the very copy of Ven. on which he formed his
text: he may have hardly known to whom they belonged; and may
harelooked on them as public property which he might make use of
without aeknowledgment according to the pusctice 01 the time 3 101
neither Pius nor Candidus scknowledges in his turn what he got
hom hwancius3 nor does Naugerius the editor of alda say a
syllable 01 Candidus whose edition he copied with few variatione
But lachmann to 111 98 cites in 11100101 his charge that Avan-
cius was a dishonest plagiary three interpolated verses which doubt
less were oomposed by Marullus and are corruptly given in Ald. 1.
ln notes 1 to 111 98 Ι have attempted to shew 110111 Gifanius that
Marullus perhaps wrote putarit, and that Avancius intended to
md the samm Avancins was probably as good a Latin scholares
Marullus, 11 less wersed in Lucretius In the line inserted after rv
1112 multae 101 malm may be an error of the printcr 01 an oversight
01 Avancius. In that inserted alter1v 532 thereoau be little doubt
tlat be purposely wrote suis, imagining that 0110 was a plural. The
eorrecting of texts was then in its infancy, and Avancius had so
grievous a taslr before him in making sense out 01 the monstronsly

from all this is that both Avancius and Marullus did rnuch 101 Lu·

peculiar 10 the J untine is 1101110111 Marullus, and much of what
Marullus did, is not in the Juntine Between them they saetly
improved a grievously corrupt text 3 and though they introduced
many perversities, we ought in simple justice to take into considera·

Aldl and Junt. agree in a reading, I mention both3 when a read·

first appears in J unt, I still say J unt, though it is always 10 be in·
