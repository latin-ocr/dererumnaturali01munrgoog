force, und things end animals beneath the earth cannot tumble into

It is the 010100 doubtlees whom Lucr. here mainly attacks, though
the peripatetica and some others held 1 similar doctrine: they taught
that there was but oue finite world surrounded by an infinite void ς
and that the world was upheld in the way which Luer. so clearly
explains here, by all things pressing to tho uentre: the earth resting
ἰσοκρατῶς, in the words of Zeno 11 Stob. 0011 114, 11 about the
centre of the κόσμος, in the same way 11111 the whole finite κόσμος
rumeins fast in the infinite void. Had Epicurus, while retaining his
conceptione of infinite space and mutter and innumerable worlds aud

centre, audeo 10 make his atoma rush from all sides of space elike
