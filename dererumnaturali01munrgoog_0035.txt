ιο the exposition 01 Lucretius. Mucb that is carious may be gethesed
from them, and I have perused them with attention3 butte say the
truth I bevenot found much te my purpose in them The author ’
was utterly devoid 01 the critical faculty, and all that is 01 velue
in him on this head is borrowed from Lambinus 3 as well as the most
useful 01 his illustratione: his corrections of the text are without
exception worthless In the 17ι11 century several distinguished seho-
lsrs, Salmasius J. F. Gronovius Nic. Heinsius Isaac Vossius, turned
their attention to Lueretiue3 but their labours were only desultory.
Of the ms. notes by the two last which are in my possession Ι will
speulr afterwards In 1662 Tanaquillns Faber 01 Tanneguy Lefebvre
published at Saumur a textos Lucretius followed by mactiones
and 0010100. Ηο was a clover but vain man, who seemed ιο think
such work rather beneath him3 ho takes care however to inform
his reader that he spent but little time or paine on it, eadhed
only Lambinus and Gifanius before him, though he owed nothing
ιο either. The truth is that without Lambinus he could 11οι have
advanced a step: elever man that he ie, he affords a good proof how
grievously Latin scholarship had deteriorated in France during the
century between him end Lambinus Of Pareus Nards'us Fayus
nothing need be said.

Hed Bentley in 1689 01 1690 succeeded 111 his efforts to obtain
for the Bodleian Isaac Vossius’ famous library, he might have antici·
pated what Lachmann did by a century and a half. As he was at
that very time working hard at Lucretius, 11 he hed once got into his
hands the two mss now at Leyden, he would at a glauce have seen
their importance and would scarcely have failed ιο complete the
edition which he was then meditating. The great knowledge of
Epicurus’ system which he displayed two years later in his Boyle
lecturas and his real 101 the recently published principia 01 Newten
would bave aided him in expounding the tenets 01 the poet This
however was not ιο be 3 but his marginal notes published in the
Glasgow edition 01 Wakefield prove what he could have done, 11 he
had gone on with his desigm I cannot doubt that Lucretius would

bare urited him better thau Horace, and have offered a fairer field
for the exorciso 01 his critical divinatiom

In 1695 there came from the Oxford presa a Lucretius edited 11οι
by Bentley, but by Thomas Creech fellow 01 All Souls, a man of
sound 001100 and good taste, but te judge from bis bools of somewhst
arrogant and supercilious temper. The text is nearly always a
reproduction 010110 or other 01 the editions of Lambinus: such criti·

him. His notes are in most cases mere abridgements 01 those of
