l sudus therefore that it is Politian's own ; and as Candidus says in

lipahoe that he collatod all the ‘vetusta exemplaria' in Floreuca
toul not have neglected this manuscript which was then in the
llnouwnventual library of San Marso. Iconolude therefore that
Candidus' taking it from the margin of Politian’s ma is the right
explanation os Ianottus’ assertion that Marullus got it from an
udeut codex. It is quite possible indeed that Marullus copied it
hinsell {rom this ms. which passed to San Marco immediately alter
lohdasi’s deaceae, and thus robbed him of his versa aster death, as he
ladrohhedhim of his bride during lise. Naugerius has in his first

corruption 1 believe to proceed from Marullus ; for his hymn to the

meatus where he has not been followed by Avancius or Can·
didus: vi sto-652 are quite correetly given hy Avanciua and in
his learned preface hc says with reference to 652 Nec toto pers oet
‘totus prima brevi, quia macti redditivus est‘. Crinitus ll. xvi
quotes 650 651 rightly, and adds ‘qua in re grammaticorum nobis

cretio pro miniosa, ne quis forte paulo incautius atque audacius a
veteribus decedat quae a mc vel ob eam rationem sunt adnotata,
quoniam Marullus Bizantius aetate nostra, vir alioqui diligens, paulo
improbius delere haec ct alia pro ingenio subdere tentavit 3 quae ab

gives these two verses rightly and says in note at end of J unt ‘eita-
