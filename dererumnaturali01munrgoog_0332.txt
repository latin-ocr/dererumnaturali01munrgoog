be a res 0010 to Jarome and his contemporaries or evan to Suetonius

ἵ I cannot see. Had Jerome found Quintus in his original, he must

have added it, nor would Suetonius himself have omitted to express
Κ11. Nor can Iperoaiva tha least internal probability in favour of
Quintus, who in those very months must have beau thinking more
of the art 01 war than the art 01 poetry 3 1οι· in tha summer 01
700 he was fighting aa Oaesark legate in Gaul and Britain. And
why should not Marcus he the editori ha does not appear to have
lesan vary actively employed during those months; and moreover

y he was one of 111000 busy men who always find time for any fresh

work they are called upon to do. It may have been a dying request

¹ of the poet’s 3 for it is mora than likely from what he says 01

Memmius that ha would look cn Cicero with admiration and esteem
him as the saviam 01 his country. Cicero’s virtues and abilities were
just 01 the sort to excite the love and wonder 01 a retired student,
who is mora apt in practice to overrate than undcrralue those who
are engaged in active life, whatever his speculativa sentimenta may
ba And hera we are not left solely to conjecture: the many imita·
tions we find in Lucretius 01 the few hundred extant lines 01 Cicero’s
Aratea prove, little as it might have been expected, that he looked
upon this translation as one 01 his poetical medela Oiearo, though
he set small atore on Epicurus and his system, was on terma cf
intimate friendship with the leading epicureans both Greek and
Roman: to one 01 tham Philodemus as it now appears from the
Herculanean fragments recently published, we know he was greatly
indabted in his de natura deorum. And if Lucretius were quita
unknown to him, a word from Atticus or even from Memmius
would have made him undertake what would seem so slight a task
to a man 01 his labsuious and energctic habits. The poem must
have been given to tha world exactly as it was left by the author,
with nothing added or taken from it to all appearance. If Cicero
then was editor, he prohably put it into tha hands 01 soma 01 his
own amanuenses or entnmted it to the large copying establishment
01 Atticus3 and he may have spent only a few houm in looking
cuerit or hearing it read to him: his name rather than his time
was probably wanted by the friends 01 Lucretius All this would
01 oourse be the idlest guesawork, if it were not for the express
statement of Jerome, thetis 01 Suetonius, that ha was editor3 a
statement which is in some measure confirmed by the younger Pliny
epist 111 15 who thus writes to his friend Pmoulus, Petis 0111101100
