This paragraph, 50-61, is in many respecta the least satisfactory
in the lst book. It has no connexion with what precedes: bnt that,
ss we have seen may bc owing to the occidental loss of some vemas:
it has no proper connexion with what follows; for thc poet passos on
to Epicurus, almost as abruptly ss he left Venus for Memmius.
Next letus test the passage itself: he tells Memmius what heis
· going to sing os: first of heaven aad the goda. That occupies only s
portion oi books 5 and 6. Thon iu the rest of the paragraph he says
he will explain the nature oi bis firstbeginnings ‚That explanation
fills a part of books l and 2. Thus he puts what is to come in the
last two books before what comes in the first two 3 and hc says not a
word cf the matters discussed in the rest of these four books and in
the whole of the ard and eth Thea the langnagc oi 56-61 seems
clumsy disjointed and ill-arranged. If now we turn to 127-135,
we sec that he first repests in· other words what he had said in 54
more briefly3 then 129 adds qao vi qaocqtoe gerantur In terrie, which
may be said to form the subject ol the rcst oi books 5and 6 3 and
then 130s011. he proceeds tum eam prima must we discuss the
nature os the soul and mind, aud tha theory cf imagen: which topica
occnpy preciscly the ard and 4th books: which in the former sum·
mary were wholly omitted. But herc on the other hand· he says
nothing oi his firstbeginnings, which in the former passages were
dwelt upon almost exclusively3 and yet the course of his poem almost
directly aster turns to this very question which is theu fully and sys-
tematically discussed. On the whole one is tempted to surmisc that
nothing has been lost before 50 ; but, what comes to the same thing,
that the passage was left imperfect by the poet and not properly con·
nected with what precedes and follows: what connexion there isis
both very abrupt and very constrained and artificial. It strikes me
that this want of finish might thus bc explained: hs first began

his poem with 62 Humano ante cados cet, just as he opens 111 ιν
and vr with a panegyric on Epicurus: A te principium, tibi desinet,
he well might feel. The paragraph much resembles in spirit those
exordia and is vell suited for such a commencement Asterwarda
