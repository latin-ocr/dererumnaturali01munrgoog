very interesting fragment of this dialogue bearing on the argument
mentioned by Lucr. 102 Ut δονιο saepe voktndo cet: it concludes

the animae is the ruling pert in the whole body and is situated in
the region of the beart ; the calma being spread through the body:
sometimes the coimus feels, when the animo does not ; but under
any violent emotion we see the anicio sympathise throughout the ⁴

ammos, and being moved by it, stirs the 'whole body. 166 oon·
