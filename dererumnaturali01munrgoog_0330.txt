EXPLAINING AND ILLUSTRATING THE Pom

Jsaosss ιιι his additions to the Eusebian chroniole has these words
Titus bematius poeta coeatur qui posteo marono porreto ere sworem
meree, cam aliquot libros per tournella smoniae comitem quos
postea Cicero mondavit, propriore omna interserit anno aetatis ων.
Donatus m his life oi Virgil writes thus according ιο Reifferscheid
Suetonii reliq. p. 55, initia aetatis cremonae egit [Vergilius] segue
ad virilem topace, quma avenne natali erm accepit amm illis eon·

Ritschl parergon p. 609—638, Mommsen ll p. tet-69³, Reif-
ferscheid l 1. p. 363-425, and others, will doubt that the whole
of J erome’s additions to the chronicle are servilely copied from the
