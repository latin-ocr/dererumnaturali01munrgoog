that we never should find in any poet 00011101ος the more so'that
1110 final syll might be elidad, as Stat Theb. 11 62 Euporo 00110111 et.
But what follows eompletes 1 think the demonstration that it is

only these two positione iu the r., never onae one of 1110 many more
oonvenient 0100, and that the a should always be elidad, is more than
improbable: take nutura or 10100ηο in Luor. and see where they
come 1111110111 whereas 00011110 would naturally form the 11101 1001,
as above in Statius, and oould aeldom have any plaee but that or the

’ body (and this would be much more natural than that it should 10

01101 110 body altogether) there it would still be within the man:
now as mind and soul not only are in our body, but hare a fixed
plaoe in that body, 11 is still more inoonoeirable that they oould exist
wholly out 0111 ; therefore the soul dies with 1110 body: nay thus to
join a mortal thing with an immortalis too absurd: 111 11 you say
the soulis 1111101111, because it is sheltered from all that would de·
